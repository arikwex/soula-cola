HITLIST
=======
- Soda auto-name / auto-color
- Soul manager behavior / level progress / layout to match soda type / word difficulty
- Game Over / Reset

Nice to have:
- Visual for mis-type
- "meep meep meep" in desperation for their desires
- Main menu
- Themed font (monospace?)
- Audio + Music
    - soul spawn sound
    - soul angry
    - soul stepping on to active region
    - Ambient pad synth drag set beat => inspired by babayaga groove and howling riff
